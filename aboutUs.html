                    <h4>About IIITG</h4>
                    <br>
                    <p>Indian Institute of Information Technology Guwahati (IIITG) is an institution of National
                        Importance under an Act of Parliament (THE INDIAN INSTITUTES OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY
                        (PUBLIC-PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP) ACT, 2017). It offers B.Tech. courses in Electronics and
                        Communication Engineering (ECE) and Computer Science Engineering (CSE), M.Tech. courses in CSE
                        and ECE and runs PhD programmes in ECE, CSE, Mathematics, and Humanities and Social Sciences
                        (HSS). IIITG started operations in August 2013 with B.Tech programmes in CSE and ECE. The first
                        batch of B.Tech. students completed their programme in May 2017. The first convocation of the
                        Institute was held on May 15 2018.The institute has further received funding for infrastructural
                        development and academic improvement under TEQIP III.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>IIITG is one of the 20 IIITs set up by the Central Govt. in PPP mode. A Bill (Act of Parliament)
                        to declare all the PPP-IIITs (including IIITG) as Institutes of National Importance was passed
                        by both the houses of the Indian parliament in July, 2017.</p>
                    <p><b>In its very first year when it became eligible, IIITG has got a rank of 66 in the Engineering
                            category of NIRF 2020. What is even more notable is that it is ranked the highest among all
                            MHRD IIITs! This includes even the older, Govt. funded IIITs! We were not eligible for
                            ranking in the Overall category as we have less than 1000 students.</b></p>
                    <br>

                        scheduled between 9 A.M. to 5 P. M. Every class room is air-conditioned and has projection
                        facilities. For online classes, we are subscribing to a Learning Management System (LMS) through
                        which we deliver our lectures. For online examinations, we have subscribed to another Cloud
                        based software. An Institute-wide wi-fi system provides Internet access throughout the
